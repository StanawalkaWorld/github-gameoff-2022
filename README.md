# Buck Shot
Repository containing source code of the game **Buck Shot**, that I made for Github GameOff 2022 game jam on itch.io

## Premise of the game

The game combines two cliches:

- A fast buck
- A long shot

The goal of the game is to shoot as many *Bucks* as possible in a set amount of time. Helping you during this mission will be various power ups to really put that *bun in the oven* 😉.
